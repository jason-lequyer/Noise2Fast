# Noise2Fast

# Installation
If you don't already have anaconda, install it by following instructions at this link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.

It would also be helpful to have ImageJ installed: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html, because issues can arise when using an image format that is not supported by the tifffile python package and these issues can be fixed by opening your images in ImageJ and re-saving them as .tif (even if they were already .tif).

Open Anaconda Prompt (or terminal if on Mac/Linux) and enter the following commands to create a new conda environment and install the required packages:

```python
conda create --name N2F
conda activate N2F
conda install -c pytorch pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge tifffile
```

# Using Noise2Fast on your 2D grayscale data

Create a folder in the master directory (the directory that contains N2F.py) and put your noisy images into it. Then open anaconda prompt/terminal and run the following:

```python
cd "masterdirectoryname"
conda activate N2F
python N2F.py "noisyfolder"
```
Replacing "masterdirectoryname" with the full path to the directory that contains N2F.py, and replacing "noisyfolder" with the name of the folder containing images you want denoised. Results will be saved to the directory "noisyfolder_N2F".
  
# Using Noise2Fast on your colour images, stacks and hyperstacks

To run on anything other than 2D grayscale images, use N2F_4D.py. This supports an arbitrary number of dimensions, as long as the last two dimensions are x and y. For example, here we use it on a 16x6x2x250x250 (tzcxy) image:
  
```python
cd "masterdirectoryname"
conda activate N2F
python N2F_4D.py livecells
```  

Output is in ImageJ format.

# Using Noise2Fast on provided datasets

To run N2F on the noisy confocal images, open a terminal and run:

```python
cd "masterdirectoryname"
conda activate N2F
python N2F.py Confocal_gaussianpoisson
```
The denoised results will be in the directory "Confocal_gaussianpoisson_N2F".

To run N2F on our other datasets we first need to add synthetic gasussian noise. For example to test N2F on Set12 with sigma=25 gaussian noise, we would first: 
```python
cd "masterdirectoryname"
conda activate N2F
python add_gaussian_noise.py Set12 25
```
This will create the folder "Set12_gaussian25" which we can now denoise:

```python
python N2F.py Set12_gaussian25
```
Which returns the denoised results in a folder named "Set12_gaussian25_N2F".

# Calculate accuracy of Noise2Fast

To find the PSNR and SSIM between a folder containing denoised results and the corresponding folder containing known ground truths (e.g. Set12_gaussian25_N2F and Set12 if you followed above), we need to install one more conda package:

```python
conda activate N2F
conda install -c anaconda scikit-image
```

Now we measure accuracy with the code:
```terminal
cd "masterdirectoryname"
python compute_psnr_ssim.py Set12_gaussian25_N2F Set12
```

You can replace "Set12" and "Set12_gaussian25" with any pair of denoised/ground truth folders (order doesn't matter). Average PSNR and SSIM will be returned for the entire set.
